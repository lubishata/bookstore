# Mockup Books

This repository contains mockup books designed to demonstrate the functionality of a bookstore application currently under development. The unique aspect of these mockup books is that they were created using a combination of AI technologies, namely ChatGPT for the book descriptions and DALL-E for the book cover images.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a visually appealing and interactive demonstration of the features and capabilities of the bookstore application. These mockup books are placeholders for the actual book data that will be populated in the application once it is fully developed.

## Mockup Books

The mockup books in this repository are a result of AI-generated content. ChatGPT, a powerful language model, was used to generate descriptive book summaries, providing engaging and informative descriptions for each book. DALL-E, an image generation model, was utilized to create unique and visually exciting book cover images.

It's important to note that these mockup books are not real publications and should not be considered as such. They were generated purely for demonstration purposes and to showcase the potential of AI in book-related applications.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── mockup-books/
│   ├── book1/
│   │   ├── description.md
│   │   └── cover.png
│   ├── book2/
│   │   ├── description.md
│   │   └── cover.png
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

The `mockup-books` directory contains subdirectories for each mockup book. Each book directory includes two main files:

1. `description.md`: This text file contains the AI-generated book description. It provides a summary, key details, and other relevant information about the book.

2. `cover.png`: This image file contains the AI-generated book cover image. It visually represents the book and adds an element of realism to the mockup.

Feel free to explore the `mockup-books` directory and review the available mockup books.

## Usage
